# Ferra

Ferra is an AI-native, general-purpose programming language designed to be as easy as Python, with Rust-class performance and memory safety. It features minimal syntax, gradual static typing, an ownership/borrow model, deterministic async/actor concurrency, and positive-first error messaging.
