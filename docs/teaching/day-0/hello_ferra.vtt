Welcome to Ferra! In this 5-minute lab,
you'll write and run your first Ferra program.
By the end, you'll have a working 'Hello, Ferra!' program
and understand the basics of the language.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's start by installing Ferra.
Open your terminal and run this command:
curl -sSL https://get.ferra.dev | sh

This will install the Ferra compiler, package manager,
and basic development tools.

Let's verify the installation:
lang --version

Great! Ferra is installed and ready to use.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now, let's create your first Ferra project.
Run these commands:

lang new hello_ferra
cd hello_ferra

This creates a new project with all the necessary files.
The src/main.lang file is where we'll write our code.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Let's write our first Ferra program.
Open src/main.lang and add this code:

fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    "Hello, " + name + "!"
}

fn main() {
    println(greet("Ferra"))
}

Let's go through what this code does:
- fn greet declares a function that takes a name and returns a greeting
- String is the type for text
- The + operator concatenates strings
- println prints to the console
- main is where your program starts

00:03:30.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now, let's build and run our program:

lang build
./hello_ferra

You should see:
Hello, Ferra!

Perfect! Your first Ferra program is working.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Congratulations! You've completed your first Ferra program.
Here's what you can do next:
1. Try modifying the greet function
2. Check out the Week-1 tutorial to build a REST API
3. Join our community Discord
4. Read the language reference

Thanks for trying Ferra! Happy coding!
