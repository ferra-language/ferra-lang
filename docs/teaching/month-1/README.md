# Month-1 Tutorial: Cross-Platform GUI + Serverless Backend

> **Duration**: 40 hours
> **Goal**: Build a full-stack application with cross-platform GUI and serverless backend

## Overview

This tutorial combines Ferra's UI-DSL capabilities with serverless backend development to create a complete, production-ready application. You'll learn how to:

1. Build a responsive GUI that works on desktop and mobile
2. Deploy a serverless backend with OCI containers
3. Handle real-time data synchronization
4. Implement secure authentication
5. Optimize for performance and energy efficiency

## Structure

The tutorial is divided into two main tracks that can be completed in parallel:

### Track 1: Cross-Platform GUI (20 hours)

1. **UI-DSL Fundamentals** (4 hours)

   - State synchronization
   - Offline support
   - Conflict resolution

5. **Testing & Deployment** (4 hours)
   - UI testing
   - Performance testing
   - App store preparation
   - CI/CD setup

### Track 2: Serverless Backend (20 hours)

1. **Serverless Architecture** (4 hours)
   - OCI container basics
   - Function design
   - Cold start optimization
   - Cost optimization

2. **Database & Storage** (4 hours)
   - Data modeling
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Backup & recovery

3. **Authentication & Security** (4 hours)

   - JWT handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Security best practices

4. **API Design & Integration** (4 hours)
   - RESTful endpoints
   - GraphQL support
   - API versioning
   - Documentation

5. **Monitoring & Operations** (4 hours)
   - Logging
   - Metrics
   - Alerting
   - Debugging

## Prerequisites

   cd fullstack_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   lang deps install
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   lang dev
   ```
