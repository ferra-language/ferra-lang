## Project Vision

Ferra aims to be an AI-native, general-purpose language that is as easy to learn as Python yet matches Rust-class performance and memory safety. Key guiding principles include minimal syntax, gradual static typing, an ownership/borrow model, deterministic async/actor concurrency, and positive-first error messaging.

This project follows the technical direction outlined in `Steps.md` and the detailed plan in `comprehensive_plan.md`.
